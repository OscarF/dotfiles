# ~/.gitconfig.local.example
# Template for machine-specific git configuration
#
# Copy this file to ~/.gitconfig.local and customize for your machine
# This file is included by .gitconfig and is NOT tracked in git
#
# Use this for:
# - User identity (name, email, signing key)
# - Conditional includes for work/personal projects
# - GitHub tokens or other credentials
# - Machine-specific git settings
# - Any configuration you don't want in version control

# Example: User identity
# [user]
#     name = Your Name
#     email = your.email@example.com
#     signingkey = YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID

# Example: Conditional includes for work vs personal projects
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/work/"]
#     path = ~/.gitconfig-work
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/personal/"]
#     path = ~/.gitconfig-personal

# Then create ~/.gitconfig-work:
# [user]
#     name = Your Work Name
#     email = you@workcompany.com
# [github]
#     user = work-username

# And ~/.gitconfig-personal:
# [user]
#     name = Your Personal Name
#     email = you@personal.com
# [github]
#     user = personal-username

# Example: GitHub configuration
# [github]
#     user = your-github-username
#     token = ghp_your_token_here

# Example: Machine-specific settings
# [core]
#     sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/specific_key

# Example: Commit signing
# [commit]
#     gpgsign = true
# [gpg]
#     program = gpg
